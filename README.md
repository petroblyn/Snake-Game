# Snake (Tkinter)

A small Snake game implemented with Tkinter.

## Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then run:

```bash
python3 snake.py
```

## Controls

- Arrow keys: Move the snake
- P: Pause / Resume
- R: Restart after GAME OVER

## Notes

- The game runs in a Tkinter window.
- Score is shown in the top bar; when the game ends press `R` to restart.

If you'd like, I can add a persistent high score file, a Restart button, or improve graphics further.
